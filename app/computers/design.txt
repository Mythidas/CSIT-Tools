** Design and Implementation planning for Computers page **

Goal:
- Provide the ability to view computer counts and information from both VSA and Sophos in one place
- Compare VSA computer counts against Sophos and find mismatches
- Show short hand report of computer counts for an office

Sub Goal:
- Provide small utilities like re enabling tamper protection from the list

Needed Functions:
- Ability to populate a dropdown list of all sites available to search
  - Need to compare sites from VSA to sites in Sophos in some fashion
    - May need a VSA site variable to define this coupling
  - Drop down should most likely be cached to avoid API calls when possible
  - Cached information leans towards hosting a db to store data
- Two different tabs that show computers separately and them a comparison tab
  - Separate lists tab will most likely have all the functionality
  - I could create a separate view for looking at an individual computer that has options/tools
  - Comparison tab will need a summary at the top to provide a quick glance count
    - Possible that this tab may need to be excel exportable for users
